This is a personal project designed to familiarize myself with TypeScript, in particular, writing simple algorithms in TypeScript.

## Summary
- The underlying JS problems that TS inherited is wack as
  - inadequate STDLIB
  - prefix notations for `Math.*` functions
  - weird for in/of iterators
- I should stop ranting and go to sleep
